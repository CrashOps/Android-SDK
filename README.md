This library will help you monitor your Android app's crashes.

## Install via gradle

### Using the plain and common maven
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/jcenter-v0.0.820-green)](https://repo.dotcms.com/artifactory/simple/jcenter/com/crashops/sdk/crashops/)

In your app-level "build.gradle" file, put:
```
   dependencies {
        implementation 'com.crashops.sdk:crashops:0.0.820'
   }
```


### Using "jitpack.io"
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/CrashOps/Android-SDK.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#CrashOps/Android-SDK)

In your root-level "build.gradle" file, put:
```
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
   }
```

In your app-level "build.gradle" file, put:
```
   dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.crashops:android-sdk:0.0.820'
   }
```


### How do I turn CrashOps off / on?
By default, CrashOps is enabled and it runs automatically as your app runs  (plug n' play) but you always can control and enable / disable its behavior with two approaches: dynamically or statically.

**Dynamically:** Programmatically call the method `disable()` / `enable()` as demonstrated here:
```kotlin
// Kotlin
CrashOps.getInstance().disable()
// OR:
CrashOps.getInstance().enable()
```

```java
// Java (pretty much like Kotlin ðŸ™‚)
CrashOps.getInstance().disable();
// OR:
CrashOps.getInstance().enable();
```

**Statically:** Add a [crashops_config.xml file](https://github.com/CrashOps/Android-SDK/blob/0.0.813/library/src/main/res/values/crashops_config.xml) to your 'values' folder and the SDK will read it in every app launch (using this approach may still be overridden by the dynamic approach). Do you wish to set different values for _debug_ / _release_ ? use [Android flavors](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants).
